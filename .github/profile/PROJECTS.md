## Tissues

For years now, I've been looking for a functional and effective way to track my tasks. A proper to-do app. The one app that I've found actually integrates well with the way I work is [Microsoft To Do](https://todo.microsoft.com/).

I was finally happy, but after using it for a while, I got a little tired of having to track my GitHub Issues & Projects _as well as_ my Microsoft To Do Tasks. Again, I started searching for potential existing ways to integrate GitHub with my Microsoft To Do. Turns out, none exist.

This is why I started [Tissues](https://github.com/mia-cx/tissues).
